## How it Works
The EA Golden Lab starts by initializing the TDI indicator with the specified period and price type. It then sets the stop loss and take profit levels for trades based on the TDI indicator values.

During each tick, the EA checks the current TDI value. If the TDI value is above 50, it opens a buy trade. If the TDI value is below -50, it opens a sell trade.
